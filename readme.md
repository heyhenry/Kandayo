# Kandayo_Ayo - A Maplestory Bossing Tracker (with a few additions) #

# Brief: 
This app is designed to create an easy and carefree manner for maplestory players to track their bossing activities. 
There is a lack of means to track bossing and mesos accumulation in a more dynamic, fluid and independent state (i.e offline), as most require the usage of excel sheets and websites.

# I am looking to provide: 
- seamless usability
- privacy
- standalone accessability
- catered experience for bossing

As a long time maplestory player and having sought out similar services, I decided to fill the void myself and potentially make it available for public use once development has stabilised.
