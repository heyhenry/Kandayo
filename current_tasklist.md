## Tasklist:

1. use a variable to store font attribute then call variable in all widgets that currently use font x
2. reduce code 
3. better comments
4. reorg locations if applicable
5. update boss images to be more on scale with each other x


?. (?) - Potentially, flip the mechanics around for lifting the existing popup post error message
?.1 Achieve this by pushing the root window behind the existing popup. 


Addressing points 1 & 3: 
- I have decided to leave it as is, and allow the user to use the update button if they want to save their decision,
prior to this, the 'reset clears only' and 'reset all' buttons will be primarily used to assist in reseting presets
so that the user can re tinker how they want to setup their checklist. 


# To Note Currently:

- make all hex colour capitalisation the same
-
