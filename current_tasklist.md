## Tasklist:

1. In bossing checklist popup - 'Reset Clears Only' does not revert mesos gained/boss crystals sold/ boss crystals remaining (** POINT OF CONTENTION **)
1.1 Note: Maybe it's fine... as when you click update its all good but did I leave it like that so to retain presets? but is that a good way to do it? think about it some more.
2. In bossing checklist popup - 'Reset All' does not update the clear icon in realtime.
3. In bossing checklist popup = 'Reset All' ** Same POINT OF CONTENTION as 1. ** (potentially discuss this point of contention with some maple veterans)
4. (?) - Potentially, flip the mechanics around for lifting the existing popup post error message
4.1 Achieve this by pushing the root window behind the existing popup. 
5. create a copy of distribution of app in main
