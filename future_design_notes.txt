For the bossing checklist...

1. Could have the orange frame be a larget set size with the single button, that when pressed alongside selecting a character in the listbox
will fill the orange frame with a image of the character + the checkboxes of all the weekly bosses, maybe even a price accumulation counter. 

2. popup of a list of all the weekly bosses when button in orange frame is pressed alongside a character in the listbox

3. utilise tkinter notebook and have the character listbox set on the 2nd tab as well + weekly bosses checklist on 
the right side that will change status depending on which character has been selected, 
to reflect the selected characters progression in clearing bosses for the week.

4. have another frame that appears on the bottom that showcases all the weekly bosses that have been cleared and those that havent so user
doesnt have to manually click on each listbox and check the checklist

*Note to self*: Initially will go with point 2 to have some content up and running, then in later version update and improve for better
user experience, readability and general accessibility of actions and desires (i.e. what is in demand for their needs)


For the realtime countdowns, clocks and trackers section...

1. Thinking of changing full text display to visual representation via circular progress bar with bare minumum text required to understand the visuals
