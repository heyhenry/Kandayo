## Tasklist:

1. Look into changing the hotlinks edit button to a cog icon with a messagebox.showinfo?
2. Re-Place the positions of the 4 timers/clocks
2.1 Potentially push them to the left side uniformly (i.e. 2 rows, 2 cols), then add a new column or rowspan2 that has a clickable image
2.1.1 clickable image to redirect to nexon's latest information webpage
2.1.1 Could have 2 clickable images, one to maplestory reddit and another to maplestory discord? or something
3. Potentially re-align the 3 stats below mesos balance
3.1 labels on the left side, and values on the right side
4. *maybe* Mesos Balance should automatically add the weekly_mesos_gained value but have it dynamic, 
in the sense that if a player decides to unclear a boss prior to next weekly reset, let the number change and be reduced in the 
mesos balance value.
5. create function for bossing_checklist_popup's reset_all button x
6. create function for bossing_checklist_popup's reset_clears_only button x
7. implement and create a reset mesos balance function x 
8. reset boss clears on thursday? (nah.. tbd if requested. current implementations make it so they can reset all information if wanted. leave for now so they can keep their presets.)
